The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster in tuple

A Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements


Lists consume more memory

Tuple consumes less memory as compared to the list


Lists have several built-in methods

Tuple does not have many built-in methods.


Unexpected changes and errors are more likely to occur


Because tuples donâ€™t change they are far less error-prone.



Lists are hetergenous in nature, where it can print multiple datatypes
