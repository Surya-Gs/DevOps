Python 

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.


Why Python?
1.  Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in open source
2. Python is suitable as extension language for customizable applications
3.  Ease of learning and readibilty:  Python has a simple and clean syntax that makes it easy to read and write code, making it accessible for beginners. Its readability reduces the cost of program maintenance and development.
4.  Versatility: Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used for various types of programming, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. Its extensive standard library and third-party packages make it versatile for almost any task
5.  Community and Ecosystem: Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its growth. This community creates numerous libraries and frameworks, making it easier to find solutions to problems and speeding up development.
6.  Portability: Python programs can run on any platform with minimal or no changes. This portability makes it convenient for developers working across different operating systems

7.  High-level Language: Python abstracts many complex details, making it easier to focus on solving the problem at hand rather than dealing with low-level implementation details
8.  Support for Object-Oriented Programming: Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, allowing developers to create reusable and modular code, leading to better organization and maintainability of codebases.
