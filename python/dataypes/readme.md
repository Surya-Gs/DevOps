Syntax


Python chracterisitics

Dynamic typing

Defenition of datatypes:
    Data types are determined at runtime

Error detection:
    Error may surface at runtime

Code Readibility
    Code may be more concise but less explicit

Flexibility
    More flexible, allow variables type to change

Compilation process
    No seperate compilation step needed




Functions

Python has inbuilt functions
Inbuilt functions are written and managed by python


Built in functions in python for the datatypes

Text types: str
Numeric types: int, float, complex
Sequence types; list, tuple, range
Mapping type: dict
Set types: set, frozenset
